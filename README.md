MESD Calendar Bundle (ver. 0.1)
===============================
> The MESD Calendar Bundle is a relatively simple Symfony package that provides a monthly/weekly/daily calendar where events can be placed onto the calendar by implementing a Symfony service that gets calls from the calendar.  The calendar provides flexibilty by having the ability to tell which calendar, what service it will call and has the ability to send an optional parameter string so that the service can filter events and tailor events to a particular calendar display.

### What Can the Calendar Do In This Version?
> MESD Calendar Bundle currently:
* Can display calendars for month, week, and day.
* Is responsive and works on a variety of screen sizes.
* Supports mulitday events.
* Ability to give the calendar events in raw html (so you can have a rendered twig appear as an event)
* Almost completely independent from twitter bootstrap (still uses button groups)

### What Can't The Calendar Do In This Version?
> MESD Calendar Bundle currently does not support:
* Draging and Dropping Events
* Having a universal click function for all days (you can add buttons and clickable elements manually, though)
* Be bugless 
* Calendar currently only has one out of the box theme
* CSS file and Twig files are still messy
